Create a README.md file and save it in the root of your site. In the readme file add information assuming that you are asked to explain the following about your portfolio in an interview, a brief description on how you created your web portfolio. This should include what challenges you faced during development and how you overcame those changes. Talk about what you learned by creating your web portfolio. Finally, include a list of any assets or resources you used that was not your own, including any frameworks, libraries, plugins, fonts, or images. Use the markdown language to format your README.md file

Hello Travis, 

### Challenges Faced

This is a very basic portfolio skeleton that I have created. I don't think it's an adaquate reflection on how the semester went, but it's the best that I could come up with in my current state. The biggest challenge I've had in creating my portfolio was finding the drive to sit on a computer for multiple hours. I have gone through probably the toughest few months of my life, almost all facets of my life have been affected one way or another. 

### Overcoming Challenges

That being said, I would like to thank you for being a great teacher. You've easily been one of, if not, the best teacher I've had in this program. I would have not been able to complete this assignment without your walkthrough videos. I really appreciate the effort you put in helping us students.

### Assets Used

As for assets, I used Adobe's library to look at XD examples, my fonts were sourced from google.com/fonts and my colour palette was inspired by coolors.com.


### Mockups

My mockup images can be assessed from the following links:

### Final Remarks

Thanks again for the great semester. I hope that you'll be my prof again in another class, but I'm also glad that I can still reach should I need any help going forward. 
Cheers, Vikram
